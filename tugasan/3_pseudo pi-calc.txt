find out if I am MASTER or WORKER

do j = 1,num
  generate 2 random numbers between 0 and 1
  xcoordinate = random1
  ycoordinate = random2
  if (xcoordinate, ycoordinate) inside circle
  then circle_count = circle_count + 1
end do

if I am MASTER

  receive from WORKERS their circle_counts
  compute PI (use MASTER and WORKER calculations)

else if I am WORKER

  send to MASTER circle_count
